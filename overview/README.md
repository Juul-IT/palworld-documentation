# Overview

Palworld is a little quirky when it comes to Multiplayer. There are currently three different multiplayer scenarios:

* Steam version
* Game pass version
* Xbox version

Each of these carries with it its' own set of problems and challenges. You can read more about this in [multiplayer.md](multiplayer.md "mention").

This space will primarily focus on the Steam version of the game, as that is the version that has the most freedom for players to setup their own servers and configure them accordingly.

Running a server for the game can be done in multiple ways too and to get started with that, you can jump straight to [installation](../installation/ "mention") for advice on self-hosting. If you do not have a server or a beefy desktop PC, we would instead recommend you consider finding a third party to work with. We have a list of server providers in [hosting-providers.md](hosting-providers.md "mention") and while we do not officially condone any of them, they are your best bet in getting a working Palworld server quickly and easy.

Want to use your own server instead? Check out the [server-requirements.md](server-requirements.md "mention")instead.
