# Multiplayer

While the game plays the same way in all three versions of the game, the multiplayer aspect of these are vastly different. To sum it up quickly:

<details>

<summary>Steam</summary>

* Up to 32 players

</details>

<details>

<summary>Game pass</summary>

* Up to 4 players

</details>

<details>

<summary>Xbox</summary>

* Up to 4 players

</details>

In general, the Steam version of the game is the one that gives players the most freedom to customize their experience in a multiplayer setting.

There is **no crossplay** functionality available between console and the PC versions. Apparently, PocketPair is working to address this.
